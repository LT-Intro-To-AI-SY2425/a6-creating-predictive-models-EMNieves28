# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r squared value is the correleation between the two values of x and y for all of the data. This r squared value of this data set is  0.6257932855322312. This shows that there is some kind of correlation between age and blood pressure. 

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?

the predicted systolic blood pressure of a person who is 42 years old is 136.52043597. 

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I don't think the model has enough data to acurately guess someone's blood pressure based on their age. If there was more data to go off of, then the predictions might be a little more accurate.
